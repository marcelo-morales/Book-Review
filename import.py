In a Python file called import.py separate from your web application, write a program that will take the books and import them into your
PostgreSQL database. You will first need to decide what table(s) to create, what columns those tables should have, and how they should relate
to one another. Run this program by running python3 import.py to import the books into your database, and submit this program with the rest of your 
project code.
